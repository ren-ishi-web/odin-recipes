        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken Tempura is deep-fried chicken breast pieces coated in Tempura batter. This hearty and delicious 
            chicken is flavored simply with salt, and it’s a more casual dish than the traditional and elaborate Tempura 
            dish with a variety of ingredients served with Tempura sauce. Variations of chicken Tempura are regional specialties
            in western Japan, where the region is known for its thriving poultry industry, but it is a solid home cooking dish after all.
            Chicken is relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, so chicken tempura has played an important role as a common food for
            the general public. The preparation method – thinly slicing the chicken, coating it in batter, and deep-frying – allows for quick
            cooking while providing a satisfying taste.
