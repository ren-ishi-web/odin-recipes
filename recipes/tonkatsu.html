        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tonkatsu (トンカツ) is one of the most beloved “western style” Japanese food
            in Japan.  It is a pork chop breaded with flour, egg, and Panko (bread crumbs)
            , then deep fried.  It’s not the healthiest Japanese food, but it is rather a 
            comfort food which everybody can’t get enough of.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pork loin chops about 1/2" thick, no bones</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt </li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2/3 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>Tonkatsu Sauce</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make small cuts all over the pork chops with the tip of a knife. Pound the meat with a meat tenderizer. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the meat.</li>
            <li>Coat the meat with flour, dip in egg, and then cover with bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Heat deep frying oil to 350 F, and deep fry the crumb-covered meat. You can check the temperature by dropping a bread crumb in the oil. If it comes up to the oil surface right after it's dropped, it's ready.</li>
            <li>Fry until the color turns golden brown and the meat floats in the oil, about 5-8 minutes, turning once or twice.</li>
            <li>Set the meat on a cooling rack for a minute. Cut into 5-6 pieces. Drizzle Tonkatsu Sauce over if you like.</li>
        </ol>
