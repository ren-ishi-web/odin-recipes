        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken Katsu is chicken fillet breaded with flour, egg, and Panko (bread crumbs), then deep fried,
            just like Tonkatsu.  It is a comfort food rather than a healthy Japanese food, but if you use cuts
            like chicken breasts or tenders instead of thighs, it can become a little lighter fare. Nonetheless, 
            Chicken Kastu is a delicious and satisfying main dish for dinner.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1-2 egg beaten</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>Tonkatsu Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Butterfly chicken breasts, cover with plastic, and flatten with a meat tenderizer (mallet). If they are too big, cut into 1/2 each. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the meat.</li>
            <li>Coat the meat with flour, dip in egg, then cover with bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Heat deep frying oil to 350 F (180 C), and deep fry crumb-covered meat.</li>
            <li>Fry until the color turns golden brown and the meat floats in the oil, about 5-8 minutes, turning once or twice.</li>
            <li>Set the meat on a cooling rack for a minute. Cut into 5-6 pieces. Drizzle Tonkatsu sauce if you like.</li>
        </ol>
